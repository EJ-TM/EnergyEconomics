It slopes upward because the quantity supplied increases as price increases, with other things constant.\n",

    "We start with the simplest supply cost curve you can imagine. In this simple OSeMOSYS model, there are two natural gas commodities (fuels) - imports of natural gas, and extraction. Both of these generate CO2, and feed a natural gas combined-cycle electricity generation plant. This produces secondary electricity `SEC_EL` which enters a transmission and distribution technology `TD` which produces final electricity `FEL`.\n",
